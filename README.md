# CSS Button Animation

## Overview
Animation can be used to attract attention. Lets attract attention to our button by making it periodically twitch.

## Instructions
1. Create the @keyframes container with a name twitch.
2. At 1%, 5%, and 9% set the transform property to rotate 10 degrees.
3. At 3%, 7%, and 11% set the transform property to rotate -10 degrees.
4. At 13% and 100% set the transform property to rotate 0 degrees.
5. Create a CSS rule for .twitch that sets the animation-name property to twitch, the animation-duration to 5s , and the animation-iteration-count to infinite.
